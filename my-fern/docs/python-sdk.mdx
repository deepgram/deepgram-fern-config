The Deepgram Python SDK can be found at the [Python SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk) repository on GitHub, along with more detailed documentation about getting up and running with the SDK.

Since Deepgram's Python SDK is an officially supported SDK, Deepgram actively works to keep the SDK up-to-date with our newest features, and as it is an open source project, we highly encourage contributions and feedback from the community.

  For those who prefer to work from a Jupyter notebook, check out our [Python Starter Notebooks](/docs/python-notebooks).
