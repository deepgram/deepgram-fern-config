  An introduction to using Deepgram's text intelligence features to analyze text
  using Deepgram SDKs.
slug: docs/text-intelligence
---


In this guide, you'll learn how to analyze text using Deepgram's text intelligence features: Summarization, Topic Detection, Intent Recognition, and Sentiment Analysis. The code examples use [Deepgram's SDKs](/docs/deepgram-sdks).

<Info>
  Before you start, you'll need to follow the steps in the [Make Your First API Request](/docs/make-your-first-api-request) guide to obtain a Deepgram API key, and configure your environment if you are choosing to use a Deepgram SDK.
</Info>

## What is Text Intelligence?

Deepgram's Text Intelligence API lets users send a text source to Deepgram, and Deepgram will perform one of four types of analysis on the content of that text. Read about each feature in its individual feature guides:

* [Summarization](/docs/text-summarization)
* [Topic Detection](/docs/text-topic-detection)
* [Intent Recognition](/docs/text-intention-recognition)
* [Sentiment Analysis](/docs/text-sentiment-analysis)

## API Playground

First, quickly explore Deepgram Text Intelligence in our API Playground.

## Make the Request

A request made using one of the text intelligence features will follow the same form for each of the features; therefore, this guide will walk you through how to make one request, and you can use the feature(s) of your choice depending on which feature you want to use (Summarization, Topic Detection, Intent Recognition, or Sentiment Analysis).

### Choose a Text

A text source can be sent to Deepgram as text (a text string or local text file) or as a url (hosted text file). These are referred to as a **basic text request** (string of text such as `"This is a string of text."`) or a **basic url request** (a hosted url such as `https://YOUR_FILE_URL.txt`).

### Basic Text Request

This example shows how to analyze a **local text file** as your text source.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript
  const { createClient } = require("@deepgram/sdk");
  const fs = require("fs");

  // path to text file
  const text = fs.readFileSync("text.txt").toString();

  const analyzeText = async () => {
    // STEP 1: Create a Deepgram client using the API key
    const deepgram = createClient(process.env.DEEPGRAM_API_KEY);

    // STEP 2: Call the analyzeText method with the text payload and options
    const { result, error } = await deepgram.read.analyzeText(
      {
        text,
      },
      // STEP 3: Configure Deepgram options for text analysis
      {
        language: "en",
        sentiment: true,
        // intents: true,
        // summarize: true,
        // topics: true,
      }
    );

    if (error) throw error;
    // STEP 4: Print the results
    if (!error) console.dir(result, { depth: null });
  };

  analyzeText();
  ```

  ```python Python
  import os
  from dotenv import load_dotenv

  from deepgram import (
      DeepgramClient,
      AnalyzeOptions,
      TextSource,
  )

  load_dotenv()

  # Path to the text file
  TEXT_FILE = "conversation.txt"

  API_KEY = os.getenv("DG_API_KEY")

  def main():
      try:
          # STEP 1 Create a Deepgram client using the API key
          deepgram = DeepgramClient(API_KEY)

          with open(TEXT_FILE, "r") as file:
              buffer_data = file.read()

          payload: TextSource = {
              "buffer": buffer_data,
          }
  				
          #STEP 2: Configure Deepgram options for text analysis
          options = AnalyzeOptions(
              language="en",
              sentiment=True,
              # intents=True,
              # summarize=True,
              # topics=True,
          )
  				
          # STEP 3: Call the analyze_text method with the text payload and options
          response = deepgram.read.analyze.v("1").analyze_text(payload, options)

          print(response.to_json(indent=4))

      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Exception: {e}")

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```

  ```go Go
  package main

  import (
  	"context"
  	"encoding/json"
  	"fmt"
  	"os"

  	prettyjson "github.com/hokaccha/go-prettyjson"

  	analyze "github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/pkg/api/analyze/v1"
  	client "github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/pkg/client/analyze"
  	interfaces "github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/pkg/client/interfaces"
  )

  // path to the text file to analyze
  const (
  	filePath string = "./conversation.txt"
  )

  func main() {
  	// STEP 1: init Deepgram client library
  	client.InitWithDefault()

  	// STEP 2: define context to manage the lifecycle of the request
  	ctx := context.Background()

  	// STEP 3: define options for the request
  	rOptions := interfaces.AnalyzeOptions{
  		Language:  "en",
  		Sentiment: true,
  		// Summarize: true,
  		// Topics: true,
  		// Intents:  true,

  	}

  	// STEP 4: create a Deepgram client using default settings
  	// NOTE: you can set your API KEY in your bash profile by typing the following line in your shell:
  	// export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY = "YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY"
  	c := client.NewWithDefaults()
  	dg := analyze.New(c)

  	// STEP 5: send/process file to Deepgram
  	res, err := dg.FromFile(ctx, filePath, rOptions)
  	if err != nil {
  		fmt.Printf("FromFile failed. Err: %v\n", err)
  		os.Exit(1)
  	}

  	// STEP 6: get the JSON response
  	data, err := json.Marshal(res)
  	if err != nil {
  		fmt.Printf("json.Marshal failed. Err: %v\n", err)
  		os.Exit(1)
  	}

  	// STEP 7: make the JSON pretty
  	prettyJson, err := prettyjson.Format(data)
  	if err != nil {
  		fmt.Printf("prettyjson.Marshal failed. Err: %v\n", err)
  		os.Exit(1)
  	}
  	fmt.Printf("\n\nResult:\n%s\n\n", prettyJson)
  }
  ```

### Basic URL Request

This example shows how to analyze a **hosted url file** as your text source.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript
  const { createClient } = require("@deepgram/sdk");

  const analyzeUrl = async () => {
    // STEP 1: Create a Deepgram client using the API key
    const deepgram = createClient(process.env.DEEPGRAM_API_KEY);

    // STEP 2: Call the analyzeUrl method with the hosted url source and options
    const { result, error } = await deepgram.read.analyzeUrl(
      {
        url: "https://static.deepgram.com/examples/aura.txt",
      },
      // STEP 3: Configure Deepgram options for text analysis
      {
        language: "en",
        sentiment: true,
        // intents: true,
        // summarize: true,
        // topics: true,
      }
    );

    if (error) throw error;
    // STEP 4: Print the results
    if (!error) console.dir(result, { depth: null });
  };

  analyzeUrl();
  ```

  ```python Python
  import os
  from dotenv import load_dotenv

  from deepgram import (
      DeepgramClient,
      AnalyzeOptions,
      UrlSource,
  )

  load_dotenv()

  API_KEY = os.getenv("DG_API_KEY")

  source: UrlSource = {
              "url": "https://static.deepgram.com/examples/aura.txt"
          } 

  def main():
      try:
          # STEP 1 Create a Deepgram client using the API key
          deepgram = DeepgramClient(API_KEY)

          #STEP 2: Configure Deepgram options for text analysis
          options = AnalyzeOptions(
              language="en",
              sentiment=True,
              # intents=True,
              # summarize=True,
              # topics=True,
          )

          # STEP 3: Call the analyze_url method with the text source and options
          response = deepgram.read.analyze.v("1").analyze_url(source, options)

          print(response.to_json(indent=4))

      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Exception: {e}")

Following are explanations of each of the example responses. Be sure to click the tabs in the code block above to view the example response for each text analysis feature.

### Summarization

In the `metadata` object, we see:

* `summary_info`: information about the model used and the input/output tokens. Summarization pricing is based on the number of input and output tokens. Read more at [deepgram.com/pricing](https://deepgram.com/pricing).

In the `results` object, we see:

* `summary`: the `text` property in this object gives you the summary of the text you requested to be analyzed.

### Topic Detection

In the `metadata` object, we see:

* `topics_info`: information about the model used and the input/output tokens. Topic Detection pricing is based on the number of input and output tokens. Read more at [deepgram.com/pricing](https://deepgram.com/pricing).

In the `results` object, we see:

* `topics`(object): contains the data about Topic Detection.

* `segments`: each segment object contains a span of text taken from the input text; this `text` segment is analyzed for its topic.

* `topics`(array): a list of topic objects, each containing the `topic` and a `confidence_score`.

  * `topic`: Deepgram analyzes the segmented text to identify the main topic of each.
  * `confidence_score`: a floating point value between 0 and 1 indicating the overall reliability of the analysis.

### Intent Recognition

In the `metadata` object, we see:

* `intents_info`: information about the model used and the input/output tokens. Intent Recognition pricing is based on the number of input and output tokens. Read more at [deepgram.com/pricing](https://deepgram.com/pricing).

In the `results` object, we see:

* `intents`(object): contains the data about Intent Recognition.

* `sentiment` can be `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral`.
* `sentiment_score`: a floating point value between -1 and 1 representing the sentiment of the associated span of text, with -1 being the most negative sentiment, and 1 being the most positive sentiment.
* `average`: the average sentiment for the entire input text.

## Constraints

Here are a few constraints to keep in mind when making your request.

### Language

At this time, text analysis features only work for English language texts. You must add a language parameter and set it to English when you make a text analysis request.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  options = AnalyzeOptions(
              language="en",
              summarize=True,
          )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Token Limit

The input token limit is 150K tokens. When that limit is exceeded, a `400` error will be thrown.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "err_code": "TOKEN_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
    "err_msg": "Text input currently supports up to 150K tokens. Please revise your text input to fit within the defined token limit. For more information, please visit our API documentation.",
    "request_id": "XXXX"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>
