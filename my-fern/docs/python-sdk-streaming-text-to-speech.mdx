The Deepgram [`Speak Clients`](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/tree/main/deepgram/clients/speak/v1/websocket) allows you to generate human-like audio from text.

<Info>
  This SDK supports both the Threaded and Async/Await Clients as described in the [Threaded and Async IO Task Support](https://developers.deepgram.com/edit/threaded-and-async-io-task-support) section. The code blocks contain a tab for `Threaded` and `Async` to show examples for `websocket` versus `asyncwebsocket`, respectively. The difference between `Threaded` and `Async` is subtle.

## Installing the SDK

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  # Install the Deepgram Python SDK
  # https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk

  pip install deepgram-sdk==3.*
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Make a Deepgram Text-to-Speech Request

The Deepgram [`Speak Clients`](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/tree/main/deepgram/clients/speak/v1/websocket) allows you to create audio generated from provided text and stream the audio bytes through your `AudioData` callback function. You can also subscribe to other important events, such as:

* `Metadata` - obtain information about the audio stream.
* `Flushed` - receive an acknowledgment when all the text has been received by Deepgram to convert to audio. This is the result of sending the `Flush` message via the `flush()` function.
* `Cleared` - that the text buffer has been cleared from Deepgram server. This is the result of sending the `Clear` message via the `clear()` function.

## Audio Output Streaming

The audio bytes representing the converted text will stream or be passed to the client via the above `AudioData` event using the callback function.

It should be noted that these audio bytes are:

* Container-less audio. Meaning depending on the `encoding` value chosen, only the raw audio data is sent. As an example, if you choose `linear16` as your `encoding` for audio, a `WAV` header will not be sent. Please see the [Tips and Tricks](/docs/handling-audio-issues-in-text-to-speech) for more information.
* Not of standard size/length when received by the client. This is because the text is broken down into sounds representing the speech. Certain sounds chained together to form fragments of spoken words are different in length and content.

Depending on what the use case is for the generated audio bytes, please visit one of these guides to better help utilize these audio bytes for your use case:

* [Sending LLM Outputs to a WebSocket](/docs/send-llm-outputs-to-the-tts-web-socket)
* [Text Chunking for Streaming TTS Optimization](/docs/text-chunking-for-tts-streaming-optimization)
* [Handling Audio Issues in Text To Speech](/docs/handling-audio-issues-in-text-to-speech)

## Where to Find Additional Examples

The SDK repository has a good collection of text-to-speech examples. The [README](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#examples) contains links to them. Each example below attempts to provide different options for transcribing an audio source.

Some Examples:

* Threaded Client speaking "Hello World" - [examples/text-to-speech/websocket/complete](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/text-to-speech/websocket/complete/main.py)

If the Async Client suits your use case better:

* Threaded Client speaking "Hello World" - [examples/text-to-speech/websocket/async\_complete](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk/blob/main/examples/text-to-speech/websocket/async_complete/main.py)
