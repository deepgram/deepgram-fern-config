The Deepgram JavaScript SDK can be found at the [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/deepgram/node-sdk) repository on GitHub, along with more detailed documentation about getting up and running with the SDK.

Since Deepgram's JavaScript SDK is an officially supported SDK, Deepgram actively works to keep the SDK up-to-date with our newest features, and as it is an open source project, we highly encourage contributions and feedback from the community.

<Info>
  The newest version of the JavaScript SDK is now released as a GA. Check out the [migration guide](/docs/node-sdk-v2-to-v3-migration-guide).
