The Deepgram JavaScript SDK now works in both server and browser environments.

## Installing the SDK

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript typescript
  # Install the Deepgram JS SDK
  # https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-js-sdk

  npm install @deepgram/sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Initialising the SDK

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript typescript
  import { createClient } from "@deepgram/sdk";

  const deepgram = createClient("DEEPGRAM_API_KEY");
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Connecting to Deepgram

Connecting to Deepgram returns an instance of `LiveClient`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript typescript
  const live = deepgram.listen.live({ model: "nova" });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Live Transcription Options

Transcription options are provided as an object to the `live(...options)` method. Each of these parameters are found as unique features on the [Streaming API reference](/reference/streaming).

## Events

Event's are available from the SDK as an enum.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript typescript
  import { LiveTranscriptionEvents } from "@deepgram/sdk";
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Events sent by the SDK

The following events are returned by the SDK.

| Event                                | Description                                                 | Data                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `LiveTranscriptionEvents.Open`       | The web socket connection to Deepgram has been opened.      | Instance of `LiveClient` |
| `LiveTranscriptionEvents.Close`      | The web socket connection to Deepgram has been closed.      | `WebSocket.CloseEvent`   |
| `LiveTranscriptionEvents.Transcript` | Deepgram has responded with a transcription result.         | `Results`                |
| `LiveTranscriptionEvents.Metadata`   | Deepgram has responded with metadata.                       | `Metadata`               |
| `LiveTranscriptionEvents.Error`      | An error occurred.                                          | `Error`                  |
| `LiveTranscriptionEvents.Warning`    | The SDK has issued a warning to do with your request/usage. | `Warning`                |

### Listening to Events

The events occur as native JS `EventListener` events. Please note, `.on()` is an alias of [addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) on an `EventEmitter`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript typescript
  live.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Open, () => {
    live.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Transcript, (data) => {
      console.log(data);
    });
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Functions

An instance of `LiveClient` has the following functionality.

### Sending Data

You can send raw audio data or text to the web socket without a content type. We will determine the appropriate encoding from the data.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript typescript
   live.send(data); 
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Keep Alive

You can send Deepgram a keep alive if you intend for deliberate moments of non-billable silence while the socket remains open. The connection will close after 12 seconds if no data is sent, but you will still be billed for an active connection if you're sending data, even if no audible words are included in the data.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript typescript
  live.keepAlive()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Read more about KeepAlive in [this comprehensive guide.](/docs/keep-alive)
</Info>

### Get Ready State

The `getReadyState` function returns the [ready state of the web socket connection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/readyState) to Deepgram.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JS
  live.getReadyState();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Toggle Features

The `configure` function gives the ability to toggle different features. Currently, only the `numerals` feature is supported. This function is a shorthand way of sending the following data to the web socket connection:

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JS
  live.configure({numerals: true}); // enable numerals
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Closing the Connection

The `requestClose` function closes the web socket connection to Deepgram.

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JS
  live.requestClose();
  ```
</CodeGroup>
