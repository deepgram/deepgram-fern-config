# What is the `FunctionCalling` Message

The `FunctionCalling`message is sent by the server to aid the client in debugging.

## Receiving `FunctionCalling`

The server will sometimes send `FunctionCalling` messages when making function calls to help the client developer debug function calling workflows. The format of this message, and whether it is sent at all, depends on the LLM provider being used.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "type": "FunctionCalling",
    ...  
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Conclusion

`FunctionCalling` messages serve as a debugging aid for client developers by providing insights into function call workflows. The structure and availability of these messages can vary depending on the LLM provider being used. By leveraging this feature, developers can better understand and troubleshoot interactions with function calls, ensuring smoother and more efficient integration with the language model.
