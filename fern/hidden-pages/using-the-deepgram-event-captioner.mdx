## Overview

Deepgram can provide non-monetary sponsorship of your event by allowing the free use of our [Event Captioner](https://deepgram-event-captioner.fly.dev/login) The Event Captioner is a great tool for your speakers, which will help them to caption their presentations in real-time as they present to an audience. 

## Terms of Use

By using the Event Captioner, you agree to [Deepgram's Terms of Service](https://deepgram.com/terms). 

Technical support for the Event Captioner is not provided by Deepgram. By using the Event Captioner, you agree to support your own event needs. 

If you have questions on the use of the Deepgram Event Captioner, please ask those in Github Discussions in the [Event Captioner](https://github.com/orgs/deepgram/discussions/categories/event-captioner) section.

## Promotion of Deepgram

By using the Deepgram [Event Captioner](https://deepgram-event-captioner.fly.dev/login), you agree to mention our company and promote us the best way possible for your event.  

## Setup

### Step 1 - Account Creation

Create an account for the Deepgram [Event Captioner](https://deepgram-event-captioner.fly.dev/login)

### Step 2 - Creating and Approving an Event

Click the **Create Event** button, and fill out the form that is provided. When you submit your request, a Deepgram admin will approve your event based on the information provided.

### Step 3 - Upon Approval

Once your event is approved, you should see the **Broadcast** and the **View** buttons on the Event Captioner page after login.

### Step 4 - Additional Information

In the days leading up to the event, let us know how many dedicated event captioner sessions you will need. 

- For example, if you have a one-stream conference, the answer is one. If you have three rooms with simultaneous talks, that’s three. 
- Currently each event captioner session will need to have an event captioner event created which will provide you with a dedicated URL for display and a dedicated URL for broadcasting.
- In most cases for a multi-session situation we'll advise you to create multiple events in the Event Captioner.

### Step 5 - Technical Setup

The broadcaster view needs to be served over `https` and have access to a microphone feed with your speaker audio.  

If you have a dedicated soundboard, pipe audio from it into a separate machine (laptop, phone) as an audio input. Select it as your mic. 

If your speakers will stand in a fixed position, placing an additional machine (laptop, phone) near the main venue microphone will allow the Event Captioner to also hear what is said.

### Step 6 - Event Day

Load up the broadcaster view, give access to your mic, and enter the provided broadcaster key. This tab must remain open, even if in the background, to capture audio and broadcast transcripts. 

Then, load the audience view in a separate screen or tab and full screen it without browser UI. 

If desired, open the settings and alter the display or auto scroll behaviors.

### Other considerations

If your speakers are likely to move, consider putting a separate device in their pocket with the Event Captioner enabled.
