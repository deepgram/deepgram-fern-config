## Formatting Text for Aura-2
# Tips and Tricks for Better Generation Quality with Aura-2

## Introduction

Aura-2 is a context-aware text-to-speech (TTS) model that applies natural pacing, expressiveness, and fillers based on the context of the provided text. The quality of your text input directly impacts the naturalness of the audio output. This guide provides strategies for optimizing your text to get the most natural-sounding speech from Aura-2.

<Info title="Note for LLM-Generated Text">
If you are using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate input text for Aura-2, you can prompt the LLM to provide conversational responses. For example, instruct the LLM to "respond in a natural, conversational tone with appropriate punctuation for text-to-speech" to get output that will sound more natural when processed by Aura-2.

## Basic Formatting Principles

* **Use proper sentence-ending punctuation.** Add periods at the end of sentences to create natural pauses. For example, write `Hello. One moment. I'm looking up your medical records.` instead of `Hello One Moment I'm looking up your medical records`.

* **Use expressive punctuation for emotional tone.** Add exclamation points to convey enthusiasm or excitement. For example, write `Thanks for contacting our support team!` instead of `Thanks for contacting our support team.`

* **Always use question marks for questions.** This ensures proper rising intonation. For example, write `Would you like to add a drink to your order for $1 more?` instead of `Would you like to add a drink to your order for $1 more`.

* **Add commas for natural breathing patterns.** Place commas strategically to create natural pauses. For example, write `You can reach us by phone, chat, or email during business hours.` instead of `You can reach us by phone chat or email during business hours.`

* **Use quotation marks for command words.** This helps emphasize specific phrases users should say. For example, write `Say "add item" to add more to your order.` instead of `Say add item to add more to your order.`

## Advanced Techniques

* **Use quotation marks for command words.** This helps emphasize specific phrases users should say. For example, write `Say "add item" to add more to your order, or say "checkout" to complete your purchase.` instead of `Say add item to add more to your order or say checkout to complete your purchase.`

* **Include commas before names in direct address.** This creates a natural greeting pause. For example, write `Hello, Maria! We have a special offer just for you today.` instead of `Hello Maria We have a special offer just for you today`.

* **Add commas in lists.** Insert commas between items in a list for natural pacing. For example, write `Would you like fries, a drink, or an apple pie with your meal?` instead of `Would you like fries a drink or an apple pie with your meal?`

* **Use short, standalone phrases for a conversational feel.** Brief statements often sound more natural than forced complete sentences. For example, `One moment. I'm searching for that information.` creates a more natural flow than a longer combined sentence.

## Special Formatting Instructions

* **Use a space between a URL or email and a question mark.** Otherwise, the question mark will be read out as part of the URL/email. For example, write `Can you send the email to developers@deepgram.com ?` instead of `Can you send the email to developers@deepgram.com?`.

* **Insert pauses with hyphens.** To create additional pauses in your text, insert "-" where you need the pause. For example, write `Your total comes to $45.82 - please pull forward to the next window.` instead of `Your total comes to $45.82 please pull forward to the next window.`

## Context-Aware Formatting

* **Adjust tone based on context.** Use different punctuation and phrasing depending on whether you need a professional or casual tone. For example, professional: `We've processed your refund according to company policy.` vs. casual: `Good news! We've processed your refund - the money should be back in your account soon.`

* **Format instructions with clear boundaries.** Use periods and hyphens to separate different steps. For example, write `Please arrive 15 minutes early. Bring your insurance card - and a list of current medications.` instead of `Please arrive 15 minutes early bring your insurance card and a list of current medications.`

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Missing punctuation** - Forces Aura-2 to guess at pacing and intonation
2. **Run-on sentences** - Creates unnatural, breathless sounding speech
3. **Inconsistent formatting** - Leads to unpredictable speech patterns
4. **Abbreviations without context** - May be misinterpreted or mispronounced
5. **Overuse of emphasis** - Too many exclamation points or capitalized words can sound unnatural
6. **No space before question mark after URLs/emails** - Causes the question mark to be read as part of the address
7. **Insufficient pauses in complex information** - Makes important details hard to comprehend

## Testing Your Text

Before implementing in production:

1. Read your text aloud naturally
2. Mark pauses where you naturally stop
3. Ensure punctuation reflects these natural pauses
4. Test variations with the Aura-2 model to find the most natural output

## Conclusion

The more natural your text input, the more natural Aura-2's speech output will be. By following these formatting guidelines, you can significantly improve the quality and naturalness of your text-to-speech implementations with Aura-2.
