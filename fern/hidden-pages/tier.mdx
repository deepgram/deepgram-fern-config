<Warning>
Deprecation warning. Please use the `model` syntax outlined in the [Models & Languages Overview](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/models-languages-overview).
</Warning>

Deepgram's tier feature allows you to associate your API requests with a specific tier architecture, which indicates the level of model you would like to use in your request.

## Tiers & Options

Below is a list of model tiers (`tier`), each of which has its own list of model options (`model`).

<Info>
To learn more about models, see [Models](/docs/model/). To learn more about pricing, see [Deepgram Pricing & Plans](https://deepgram.com/pricing/).

### Nova 2

```
https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?tier=nova&model=2-general
```

Nova-2 expands on Nova-1's advancements with speech-specific optimizations to the underlying Transformer architecture, advanced data curation techniques, and a multi-stage training methodology. These changes yield reduced word error rate (WER) and enhancements to entity recognition (i.e. proper nouns, alphanumerics, etc.), punctuation, and capitalization. Nova-2 has the following options:

- `general`: Optimized for everyday audio processing.
- `meeting`: Optimized for conference room settings, which include multiple speakers with a single microphone.
- `phonecall`: Optimized for low-bandwidth audio phone calls.
- `voicemail`: Optimized for low-bandwidth audio clips with a single speaker. Derived from the phonecall model.
- `finance`: Optimized for multiple speakers with varying audio quality, such as might be found on a typical earnings call. Vocabulary is heavily finance oriented.
- `conversationalai`: Optimized for use cases in which a human is talking to an automated bot, such as IVR, a voice assistant, or an automated kiosk.
- `video`: Optimized for audio sourced from videos.
- `medical`: Optimized for audio with medical oriented vocabulary.
- `drivethru`: Optimized for audio sources from drivethrus.
- `automotive`: Optimized for audio with automative oriented vocabulary.

### Nova

Nova model tiers are our newest and most powerful speech-to-text models on the market today. Deepgram's Nova models have the following options:

- `general`: Optimized for everyday audio processing. Likely to be more accurate than any region-specific Base model for the language for which it is enabled. If you aren't sure which model to select, start here.

- `phonecall`: Optimized for low-bandwidth audio phone calls.

The Nova tier and its model options can be called with the following syntax:

```
https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?tier=nova&model=general
```

```
https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?tier=nova&model=OPTION
```

If the `model` parameter is unset, it will default to `general`. Read the [Nova Quickstart](/docs/nova-quickstart) to learn more about getting started with Nova.

### Enhanced

Enhanced model tiers are still some of our most powerful ASR models; they generally have higher accuracy and better word recognition than our base models, and they handle uncommon words significantly better. Deepgram's Enhanced models have the following options:

- `general`: Optimized for everyday audio processing. Likely to be more accurate than any region-specific Base model for the language for which it is enabled. If you aren't sure which model to select, start here.

- `meeting` _beta_: Optimized for conference room settings, which include multiple speakers with a single microphone.

- `phonecall`: Optimized for low-bandwidth audio phone calls.

- `finance` _beta_: Optimized for multiple speakers with varying audio quality, such as might be found on a typical earnings call. Vocabulary is heavily finance oriented.

The Enhanced tier and its model options can be called with the following syntax:

```
https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?tier=enhanced&model=general
```

```
https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?tier=enhanced&model=OPTION
```

If the `model` parameter is unset, it will default to `general`.

### Base

Base model tiers are built on our signature end-to-end deep learning speech model architecture. They offer a solid combination of accuracy and cost effectiveness in some cases. Deepgram's Base models have the following options:

- `general`: (Default) Optimized for everyday audio processing.
- `meeting`: Optimized for conference room settings, which include multiple speakers with a single microphone.
- `phonecall`: Optimized for low-bandwidth audio phone calls.
- `voicemail`: Optimized for low-bandwidth audio clips with a single speaker. Derived from the phonecall model.
- `finance`: Optimized for multiple speakers with varying audio quality, such as might be found on a typical earnings call. Vocabulary is heavily finance oriented.
- `conversationalai`: Optimized to allow artificial intelligence technologies, such as chatbots, to interact with people in a human-like way.
- `video`: Optimized for audio sourced from videos.

The Base tier and its model options can be called with the following syntax:

```
https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?tier=base&model=general
```

```
https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?tier=base&model=OPTION
```

If the `model` parameter is unset, it will default to `general`.

<Warning>
You should only submit model options that are available for a particular tier; submitting a model option that is not available for a tier will result in a parse error. All tiers should have a `general` model available.
</Warning>

### Try it out

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer using a particular tier, run the following curl command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

```bash cURL
curl \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
  --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?tier=OPTION'
```

<Warning>
Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).
