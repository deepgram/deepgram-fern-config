Streaming audio from Deepgram Aura Text-to-Speech (TTS) into an ongoing Twilio phone call requires the use of the [Twilio streaming API.](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/stream)

## Before you Begin

<Info>
  Before you can use Deepgram, you'll need to [create a Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys). Signup is free and includes **$200** in free credit and access to all of Deepgram's features!
</Info>

<Info>
  Before you start, you'll need to follow the steps in the [Make Your First API Request](/docs/make-your-first-api-request) guide to obtain a Deepgram API key, and configure your environment if you are choosing to use a Deepgram SDK.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

For the complete code used in this guide, please [check out this repository](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/deepgram-twilio-streaming-python/tree/nikolawhallon-tts).

You will need:

* A [free Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) with a Twilio phone number.
* [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to let Twilio access a local server OR your own hosted server.
* Understanding of Python and using Python virtual environments.

## TwiML Bin Setup

First, you will need to set up a `TwiML Bin`. You can refer to the docs on how to do that in the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/docs/serverless/twiml-bins).

<Info>
  Deepgram Aura TTS is not available via the [Twilio`<Say>`verb](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/say). Instead you will use a URL.
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
  ```xml xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

  <Response>
      <Say language="en">"This call may be monitored or recorded."</Say>
      <Connect>
          <Stream url="wss://a127-75-172-116-97.ngrok-free.app/twilio" />
      </Connect>
  </Response>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You should replace the url with wherever you decide to deploy the server we are about to create and ensure`/twilio` is at the end of the url.

In the `TwiML Bin` example above, ngrok is used to expose the server running locally.

### Using ngrok

ngrok is recommended for quick development and testing but shouldn't be used for production instances.

To use ngrok see their [documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/).

Be sure to set the port correctly to align with the server code provided by running this command when you start the ngrok server.

```
ngrok http 5000
```

<Info>
  If you restart your ngrok server, your URL will change, which will require you to update your `TwiML Bin`
</Info>

### Connecting a Twilio phone number

Your `TwiML Bin` must then be connected to one of your Twilio phone numbers so that it gets executed whenever someone calls that number. If you need to set up a phone number and connect it to your `TwiML Bin`, refer to the [Twilio Docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/serverless/twiml-bins/getting-started#wire-your-twiml-bin-up-to-an-incoming-phone-call).

<Info>
  In your `TwiML Bin` The `<Connect>` verb is required for bi-directional communication, i.e. in order to send audio from Aura TSS to Twilio, you must use this verb.
</Info>

## Building the Server

Copy the `twilio.py`code from the [repository](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/deepgram-twilio-streaming-python/blob/nikolawhallon-tts/twilio.py) as we will use this in the steps below and save this code locally as with a file name of `twilio.py`.

At this point you'll want to start up a virtual environment for Python. Please refer to documentation for how to do that based on your personal Python preferences.

Depending on your situation you may also need to install specific packages used in this code.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  pip install package_name
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If your `TwiML Bin` is setup correctly, you can now navigate to this files location in your terminal and run the server with the following command:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  python twilio.py
  ```
</CodeGroup>

OR

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell shell
  python3 twilio.py
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You can then start making calls to the phone number your `TwiML Bin` is using. Without any further modifications, you should hear Deepgram Aura say simply: "Hello, how are you today?"

## Code Tour

Let's dive into the code used in the [twilio.py](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/deepgram-twilio-streaming-python/blob/nikolawhallon-tts/twilio.py) file.

First, we have some import statements:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  import asyncio
  import base64
  import json
  import sys
  import websockets
  import ssl
  import requests
  ```
</CodeGroup>

* We are using `asyncio` and `websockets` to build an asynchronous websocket server.
* We will use `base64` to handle encoding audio from Aura to pass data to Twilio.
* We will use `json` to deal with parsing text messages from Twilio .
* We will use `requests` to make HTTP requests to Deepgram's Aura/TTS endpoint.

Next we have:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  async def twilio_handler(twilio_ws):
      streamsid_queue = asyncio.Queue()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

* We will be spinning up asynchronous tasks for receiving messages from, and sending messages to, Twilio.
* We will use this `streamsid_queue` to pass the stream `sid` from the `twilio_receiver` task to the `twilio_sender` task.
* We need to specify this stream `sid` to ensure that audio from Deepgram Aura is routed correctly to the corresponding phone call.

The `twilio_receiver` task is defined next:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
      async def twilio_receiver(twilio_ws):
          async for message in twilio_ws:
              try:
                  data = json.loads(message)

                  if data['event'] == 'start':
                      streamsid_queue.put_nowait(data['start']['streamSid'])
              except:
                  break
  ```
</CodeGroup>

* This task simply loops over incoming websocket messages from Twilio and extracts the stream sid when it gets it.

Next we have the `twilio_sender` task:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
      async def twilio_sender(twilio_ws):
          print('twilio_sender started')

          # wait to receive the streamsid for this connection from one of Twilio's messages
          streamsid = await streamsid_queue.get()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

* We first wait to receive the stream sid.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
          # make a Deepgram Aura TTS request specifying that we want raw mulaw audio as the output
          url = 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/speak?model=aura-asteria-en&encoding=mulaw&sample_rate=8000&container=none'
          headers = {
              'Authorization': 'Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY',
              'Content-Type': 'application/json'
          }
          payload = {
              'text': 'Hello, how are you today?'
          }
          tts_response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

* Then we make a request to Deepgram Aura TTS to say "Hello, how are you today?" specifying an audio format of raw, 8000 Hz, mulaw.

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](/docs/create-additional-api-keys).
</Warning>

Next we have:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
          if tts_response.status_code == 200:
              raw_mulaw = tts_response.content

              # construct a Twilio media message with the raw mulaw (see https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/stream#websocket-messages---to-twilio)
              media_message = {
                  'event': 'media',
                  'streamSid': streamsid,
                  'media': {
                      'payload': base64.b64encode(raw_mulaw).decode('ascii')
                  }
              }

              # send the TTS audio to the attached phonecall
              await twilio_ws.send(json.dumps(media_message))
  ```
</CodeGroup>

* Here we package up the Deepgram Aura TTS audio in the format Twilio expects.
* We specify the stream `sid`.
* We send that audio back to Twilio via the websocket connection.
* To better understand what is occurring at this step please refer to the[ Twilio docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/stream#websocket-messages---to-twilio) for more details.

Additionally, if your application requires the bot to stop speaking at any point, you can do that simply by sending a "clear" message to Twilio.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  await twilio_ws.send(json.dumps({"event": "clear", "streamSid": streamsid}))
  ```
</CodeGroup>

To close out our websocket handler, we run these two asynchronous tasks with `asyncio`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
      await asyncio.wait([
          asyncio.ensure_future(twilio_receiver(twilio_ws)),
          asyncio.ensure_future(twilio_sender(twilio_ws))
      ])

      await twilio_ws.close()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Finally, for some scaffolding to spin up the server and pointing requests to get handled by the above function, we have:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  async def router(websocket, path):
      if path == '/twilio':
          print('twilio connection incoming')
          await twilio_handler(websocket)

  def main():
      # use this if using ssl
  #	ssl_context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER)
  #	ssl_context.load_cert_chain('cert.pem', 'key.pem')
  #	server = websockets.serve(router, '0.0.0.0', 443, ssl=ssl_context)

      # use this if not using ssl
      server = websockets.serve(router, 'localhost', 5000)

      asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(server)
      asyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever()

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      sys.exit(main() or 0)
  ```
</CodeGroup>
