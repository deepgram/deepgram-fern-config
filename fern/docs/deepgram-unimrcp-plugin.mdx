title: Deepgram UniMRCP Plugin
subtitle: >-
  Deepgram offers a plugin for speech recognition for the UniMRCP Server (UMS),
  which is a popular open-source project that offers cross-platform MRCP
  services. To use this plugin with self-hosted deployments, you must take some
  additional steps.

## Deploying UniMRCP Self-Hosted

In addition to the installation guide posted at [UMS Deepgram SR - Deb Installation Manual](https://docs.unispeech.io/en/ums/deepgram/speech-recog/install-deb), the following changes are required to successfully integrate `umsdeepgram` with a self-hosted deployment.

### Adding a new `service-endpoint` for self-hosted

In the `umsdeepgram.xml` configuration file, add a `service-endpoint` child element to the `service-endpoints` element. You must specify the self-hosted deployment’s IP address and port number in the `service-uri` attribute. The URI's path is `/v1/listen/stream`, and the protocol should use only a web socket (`ws`), not a secure web socket (`wss`).

<CodeGroup>
  ```xml xml
  <service-endpoints load-balancing="round-robin" fail-over="true">
        <service-endpoint enable="true" service-uri="ws://SELF_HOSTED_IP_ADDRESS:SELF_HOSTED_PORT/v1/listen/stream"/>
  </service-endpoints>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This can coexist alongside a hosted service-endpoint.

<CodeGroup>
  ```xml xml
  <service-endpoints load-balancing="round-robin" fail-over="true">
        <service-endpoint enable="true" service-uri="ws://SELF_HOSTED_IP_ADDRESS:SELF_HOSTED_PORT/v1/listen/stream"/>
        <service-endpoint enable="true" service-uri="wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen"/>
  </service-endpoints>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Deepgram License Key

Authorization is performed at the request level for the hosted Deepgram API by including an API key in your request headers. In contrast, authorization for self-hosted Deepgram environments is performed at the container level, and individual requests that are able to hit your private self-hosted environment are assumed to be authorized already (possibly in some previous layer of your networking stack).

For the UniMRCP plugin, the `deepgram.subscription.key` file must exist and match the schema specified in the plugin installation instructions. For the hosted Deepgram API, this means setting the `auth-key` field with a valid Deepgram API key. If you are using both the hosted API and your own self-hosted environment, make sure to set this value.

If you are exclusively using your self-hosted environment, the `auth-key` value can be empty, such as:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  {
  	"auth-key": ""
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>
