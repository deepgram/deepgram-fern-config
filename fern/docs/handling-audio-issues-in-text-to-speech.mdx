Text-to-speech (TTS) technology involves challenges like producing natural-sounding speech and eliminating audio errors. Achieving high-quality output requires careful text pre-processing, accurate phonetic and prosodic modeling, and post-processing steps like noise reduction and compression.

Deepgram handles much of this for you, but if you are experiencing issues with your text-to-speech output, this guide will help you troubleshoot those problems.

# Common problems

## Attempting to Play Audio in a Web Browser

When attempting to play generated audio within a web browser, like Chrome, you may not hear any audio playing from your speakers because the stream is not containerized audio (ie, audio with a defining header, for example: `wav` header).

Currently, the Text-to-Speech WebSocket implementation does not support containerized audio formats. To support playing audio through a web browser, it is recommended that you create and prepend a containerized audio header for your audio output bytes each time they are generated.

In the `linear16` audio encoding case, you will need to prepend a [`WAV` container header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV#WAV_file_header) to each audio segment you plan to play through the speakers. This is required for many media device implementations within a browser. In several cases for Python, this may be sufficient for a `WAV` header in the case of a file:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  import wave

  # Generate a generic WAV container header
  header = wave.open(AUDIO_FILE, "wb")
  header.setnchannels(1)  # Mono audio
  header.setsampwidth(2)  # 16-bit audio
  header.setframerate(16000)  # Sample rate of 16000 Hz
  header.close()

  # then continue saving the rest of the audio stream to the file
  ```
</CodeGroup>

In many cases, file-based playback is not desired, and you may want to play the audio directly by streaming to the media device. For those cases, you may need to manipulate the audio stream and create the header bytes directly in front of the audio stream segments. In Go, this may look like the following:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript
  // Add a wav audio container header to the file if you want to play the audio
  // using the AudioContext or media player like VLC, Media Player, or Apple Music
  // Without this header in the Chrome browser case, the audio will not play.
  const wavHeader = Buffer.from([
    0x52, 0x49, 0x46, 0x46, // "RIFF"
    0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, // Placeholder for file size
    0x57, 0x41, 0x56, 0x45, // "WAVE"
    0x66, 0x6D, 0x74, 0x20, // "fmt "
    0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, // Chunk size (16)
    0x01, 0x00,             // Audio format (1 for PCM)
    0x01, 0x00,             // Number of channels (1)
    0x80, 0xBB, 0x00, 0x00, // Sample rate (48000)
    0x00, 0xEE, 0x02, 0x00, // Byte rate (48000 * 2)
    0x02, 0x00,             // Block align (2)
    0x10, 0x00,             // Bits per sample (16)
    0x64, 0x61, 0x74, 0x61, // "data"
    0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00  // Placeholder for data size
  ]);

  // Concatenate the header to your audio buffer
  const audio = Buffer.concat([wavHeader, audioBuffer]);
  ```

  ```python Python
  # Add a wav audio container header to the file if you want to play the audio
  # using the AudioContext or media player like VLC, Media Player, or Apple Music
  # Without this header in the Chrome browser case, the audio will not play.
  header = bytes(
    [

There may be variations in creating this header based on the goals of your application.

## DC Offset

DC (Direct Current) offset refers to a mean amplitude displacement from zero in an audio signal. Essentially, it means the audio waveform is not centered on the zero axis. This can cause problems such as reduced headroom, distortion, and other audio inefficiencies.

### Identifying DC Offset

* **Visual Inspection:** In an audio editing software, the waveform will appear shifted up or down above or below the zero axis.
* **Measurement:** Calculate the average amplitude of the signal over time.

**No DC Offset**

![This audio doesn't contain a DC Offset.](/images/af63e2a-no-dc-offset.png)

This audio doesn't contain a DC Offset.

**DC Offset**

![This audio does contain a DC Offset.](/images/b93157b-dc-offset.png)

This audio does contain a DC Offset.

### Correcting DC Offset

* **DC Offset Removal Tool:** Most audio editing software, like [Audacity ](https://www.audacityteam.org/)provides a DC offset correction tool.
* **High-pass Filtering:** Applying a high-pass filter with a very low cutoff frequency can also remove DC offset.
* Correcting DC offset is important to ensure the audio signal's integrity and to prevent unwanted noise and distortion.

## Audio clicking noises

### Using container=none

When attempting to play generated audio direct to an output device (like using Portaudio) for streaming audio playback, we recommend adding `container=none` to your request to prevent request header information from being misinterpreted as audio, which can result in static or click sounds. If you've changed the encoding and still are hearing clicks, it might be another problem.

Depending on your use case, you may require containerized audio. To understand the differences when to use one of the other, check out the [Getting Started Guide](/docs/text-chunking-for-tts-optimization-copy#code-examples-for-tts-websockets).

  To Learn more about the the different text-to-speech encoding option see [this guide.](/docs/tts-encoding)
</Info>

### Analyzing audio with FFMPEG

[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) can be used to analyze audio and is a very powerful tool. You can use the tool to analyze your audio files with audio issues, such as clicking noises.

For example, you could take an audio file that is having clicking noises and run:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  ffmpeg -f mulaw -codec:a pcm_mulaw -ar 8000 -ac 1 -i your_audio_file -f s16le -codec:a pcm_s16le -ar 8000 -ac 1 pipe:1 | aucat -c 0:0 -e s16le -f snd/1 -h raw -r 8000 -i
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Then, import the raw audio into [Audacity ](https://www.audacityteam.org/)for further analysis.

</Info>

## Audio header issues

In some cases, additional headers might be added to the response, which could cause audio playback issues. For example, if you request `container=wav` then you should expect only 1 `wav` header at the beginning of the response.

You can inspect your audio headers by first doing a `hexdump` before reading the audio file on your terminal.

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  hexdump -C your_audio_file
  ```
</CodeGroup>

In the terminal you'll see output as such, in this case we see duplicate wave headers and there are two RIFF headers in the audio.

This is the source of the clicking.

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell

## Audio includes other type of data

Ensure your audio output contains no additional data types besides an audio response. For example, a common issue users face is when incorrect code contains `JSON` in the audio response. This can sometimes be inserted after a Flush `JSON` message from Deepgram has returned indicating a web socket stream has closed.
