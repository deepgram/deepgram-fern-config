Using Deepgram's fully hosted Whisper Cloud instead of running your own version provides many benefits. Some of these benefits include:

* Pairing the Whisper model with Deepgram features that you can’t get using the OpenAI speech-to-text API, such as diarization and word timings.
* Support for all Whisper model sizes: tiny, base, small, medium, and large.
* Support for up to 5 concurrent requests for the Pay As You Go and Growth plans.

Deepgram hosts and maintains these Whisper models; they aren’t hosted or run by Open AI. Therefore, data sent through API requests for our Whisper models will not be sent to OpenAI.

<Warning>
  Live streaming is not available with Deepgram Whisper Cloud. If you would like to transcribe live streamed audio, we recommend using our Nova-3 model. [This guide](/docs/getting-started-with-live-streaming-audio) can help you get started.
</Warning>

## Getting Started

In this guide, you’ll learn how to transcribe pre-recorded audio using Deepgram’s hosted Whisper API.

### Create a Deepgram Account

<Info>
  Before you can use Deepgram, you'll need to [create a Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys). Signup is free and includes **$200** in free credit and access to all of Deepgram's features!
</Info>

### Create a Deepgram API Key

<Info>
  Before you start, you'll need to follow the steps in the [Make Your First API Request](/docs/make-your-first-api-request) guide to obtain a Deepgram API key, and configure your environment if you are choosing to use a Deepgram SDK.
</Info>

### Transcribe a Remote File

Transcribe a remote file using Deepgram's Whisper API with the following request.

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl cURL
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{"url":"https://static.deepgram.com/examples/Bueller-Life-moves-pretty-fast.wav}' \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=whisper'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If you would like to use a Deepgram SDK to make the request, follow the steps in the [Pre-Recorded speech-to-text ](/docs/getting-started-with-pre-recorded-audio)guide, but change the model to `whisper`.

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](/docs/create-additional-api-keys).
</Warning>

          ]

      ]
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Enable Whisper Model and Sizes

To enable Deepgram’s Whisper API, add a model parameter in the query string and set it to `model=whisper`

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Bash
  https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=whisper
  ```
</CodeGroup>

To enable a specific size of the Whisper model, set the model parameter to `model=whisper-size`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Bash
  https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=whisper-SIZE
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  If `model=whisper` is supplied and no model size specified, the model size will default to `model=whisper-medium`.
</Info>

These are the Deepgram Whisper Cloud models available:

* `model=whisper` (defaults to whisper-medium)
* `model=whisper-tiny`
* `model=whisper-base`
* `model=whisper-small`
* `model=whisper-medium`
* `model=whisper-large` (defaults to large-v2)

## Other Features

### Language Detection

Deepgram Whisper Cloud supports language detection, which means just by setting `detect_language=true`, your audio will be transcribed in the detected language.

Officially supported languages include Afrikaans, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Belarusian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Kazakh, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Malay, Marathi, Maori, Nepali, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tagalog, Tamil, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese, and Welsh. ([Source: "Whisper API FAQ"](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7031512-whisper-api-faq))

#### Supported languages

Languages supported by whisper include: `en`, `zh`, `de`, `es`, `ru`, `ko`, `fr`, `ja`, `pt`, `tr`, `pl`, `ca`, `nl`, `ar`, `sv`, `it`, `id`, `hi`, `fi`, `vi`, `he`, `uk`, `el`, `ms`, `cs`, `ro`, `da`, `hu`, `ta`, `no`, `th`, `ur`, `hr`, `bg`, `lt`, `la`, `mi`, `ml`, `cy`, `sk`, `te`, `fa`, `lv`, `bn`, `sr`, `az`, `sl`, `kn`, `et`, `mk`, `br`, `eu`, `is`, `hy`, `ne`, `mn`, `bs`, `kk`, `sq`, `sw`, `gl`, `mr`, `pa`, `si`, `km`, `sn`, `yo`, `so`, `af`, `oc`, `ka`, `be`, `tg`, `sd`, `gu`, `am`, `yi`, `lo`, `uz`, `fo`, `ht`, `ps`, `tk`, `nn`, `mt`, `sa`, `lb`, `my`, `bo`, `tl`, `mg`, `as`, `tt`, `haw`, `ln`, `ha`, `ba`, `jw`, `su`.

If you would like to transcribe audio in a specific language, you can do so by setting the language parameter in the query string. You can pass in any language code supported by [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/tokenizer.py) through our `language` parameter. To learn more about languages, see [Language](/docs/language/).

## Caveats

* It's important to understand that Whisper models are less scalable than all other Deepgram models due to their inherent model architecture. Deepgram's non-Whisper models will return results faster and scale to a higher load, so we recommend using a Deepgram model such as Nova if it can meet your needs.
* There is a 10 minute time out for all Deepgram models. Transcription requests that run longer than 10 minutes will return a 504 error.
