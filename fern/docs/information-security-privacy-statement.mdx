Deepgram is committed to protecting the confidentiality of information provided by its clients. We maintain an information security initiative that has implemented administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to reasonably and appropriately ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our client information and intellectual property.

We are a software-based service; we understand that technology and risk change over time. Therefore, we request valid third-parties to conduct risk assessments and continually evaluate, modify, and adjust our security procedures, policies, and standards, along with ensuring that everything we do matches our documented compliance processes at least yearly.

Deepgram retains a security advisor for Information Security, Risk Management, and Compliance who is responsible for guiding all security strategy, policy development, enforcement, training, and maintaining a security-minded culture. The advisor is also responsible for revisions of our incident response process and procedures.

Deepgram retains an independent Data Protection Officer, who is responsible for all data privacy matters, oversight, and governance. You can find [our privacy policy](https://deepgram.com/privacy/), which defines our continuous commitment to upholding privacy to the utmost importance, on [our website](https://deepgram.com/). You can [reach our DPO via email](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4622362906222323362134272b6825292b).

As part of our third-party vendor management program, we validate our third parties (supply chain) to ensure they meet or exceed our strict data privacy and compliance standards.

Deepgram's Information Security initiative has been designed using industry best practices and industry frameworks (such as PCI, HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA), which enables our organization to comply with federal and state laws and regulations related to its business and services.
