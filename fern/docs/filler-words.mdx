<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/deepgram/image/upload/v1717523786/devex/codey-greeting_rekqe1.svg" alt="Deepgram API Playground"/>   Try this feature out in our [API Playground](https://playground.deepgram.com/?endpoint=listen\&filler_words=true\&language=en\&model=nova-2)!
</span>
</div>

Deepgram is capable of transcribing the following filler words:

* uh
* um
* mhmm
* mm-mm
* uh-uh
* uh-huh
* nuh-uh

These words will always be transcribed with the spelling listed above, regardless of their spoken duration (i.e., Deepgram will never transcribe "uhhhh" instead of "uh").

## Enable Feature

To enable Filler Words you can use the`filler_words` query parameter and set the value to `true`.

When `filler_words=false` or the parameter is not set, the two most common fillers, "uh" and "um", are stripped out of the transcript to improve readability.

<Info>
  Currently, Filler Words are only available for Deepgram's Nova, Nova-2 and Nova-3 general models.
