## Enable Feature

To enable Find and Replace, use the following parameter in the querystring:

`replace=TERM_OR_PHRASE_TO_FIND:REPLACEMENT_TERM_OR_PHRASE`

The find term should be always be lowercase and the replacement term can be any case.

<Info>
  The suggested maximum number of terms for Find and Replace is 200. Above 200 terms, please [contact us](https://deepgram.com/contact-us) to learn about custom model training.

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following curl command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash curl
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
    --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?replace=TERM_OR_PHRASE_TO_FIND:REPLACEMENT_TERM_OR_PHRASE'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](/docs/create-additional-api-keys).
</Warning>

### Replace a Single Term

To replace a single term, send one instance of the `replace` parameter in the query string when calling the API:

`replace=monika:monica`

`replace=monika:Monica`

### Replace Multiple Terms

You can replace multiple terms individually:

`replace=monika:monica&replace=hailee:hailey`

`replace=monika:monica&replace=Hailee:Hailey`

### Replace a Phrase

You can replace a phrase. URL-encode the phrase when submitting it.

`replace=monika%20jon:monica%20john`

`replace=monika%20jon:Monica%20John`

### Remove a Term or Phrase

You can remove a term or phrase by not submitting a replacement.

`replace=monika`

## Capitalization

You can selectively replace capitalized words by capitalizing the word-to-be-replaced.

This is particularly useful for proper nouns and named entities. Deepgram's transcription will make an educated guess when spelling unfamiliar named entities. In some cases, the capitalization of words or proper nouns may be incorrect so you can use capitalization to correct any inconsistencies. For example:

`replace=ZenDesk:Zendesk`

### Backwards Compatibility

Prior to support for capitalization, `replace=zendesk=Zendesk` would replace all instances of the letters `zendesk` (ignoring capitalization) with `Zendesk`. To maintain backwards compatibility, the behavior is the same when the word-to-be-replaced is composed of entirely lowercase letters.

When submitting replacements for the same word with different capitalization, the capitalized version of the word takes precedence. For example, if you submit `replace=It:The%20monster&replace=it:the%20monster`, `It` will be replaced with `The monster` and `it` will be replaced with `the monster` because the replacement for `It` takes precedence over `it`. However, if you submit only `replace=it:the%20monster`, both `it` and `It` will be replaced with `the monster` to maintain backwards compatibility.

## Analyze Response

We want to replace the term "kpis" in this audio file with the full term "Key Performance Indicators".

In our terminal, we run the following curl command:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash curl
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data '{"url":"https://developers.deepgram.com/data/audio/interview_speech-analytics.wav"}' \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?replace=kpis:Key%20Performance%20Indicators
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](/docs/create-additional-api-keys).
</Warning>

When the file is finished processing, you’ll receive a JSON response. Let's look more closely at the `words` object within the `alternatives` object within this response. Notice that the audio contains an occurrence of the word "kpis":

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  ...
  {
    "alternatives": [
    {
      "words": [
          ...
          {
            "word":"kpis",
            "start":14.20957,
            "end":14.70957,
            "confidence":0.9946289
          },
          ...
        ]
       ...
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

However, this has been replaced with "Key Performance Indicators".

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  {
    "alternatives": [
      { 
        "words": [
          ...
          {
            "word": "Key",
            "start": 14.20957,
            "end": 14.355842,
            "confidence": 0.99620026
          },
          {
            "word": "Performance",
            "start": 14.355842,
            "end": 14.502113,
            "confidence": 0.99620026
          },
          {
            "word": "Indicators",
            "start": 14.502114,
            "end": 14.648386,
            "confidence": 0.99620026
          },
          ...
        ]
       ...
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

In this part of the response, notice:

* the replacement word `Key` retains the same `start` value as the original word `kpis`.
* the replacement words have different `end` values than the original word `kpis`. This is because we replaced one word with three words, so the total time was divided roughly evenly between the words. If we were replacing one word with one word, the start and end times would be the same.
