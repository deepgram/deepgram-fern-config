## Before You Start

Before you run the code, you'll need to do a few things.

### Create a Deepgram Account

<Info>
  Before you can use Deepgram, you'll need to [create a Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys). Signup is free and includes **$200** in free credit and access to all of Deepgram's features!
</Info>

### Create a Deepgram API Key

<Info>
  Before you start, you'll need to follow the steps in the [Make Your First API Request](/docs/make-your-first-api-request) guide to obtain a Deepgram API key, and configure your environment if you are choosing to use a Deepgram SDK.
</Info>

### Install JQ

In this guide, we use `jq`, which is an excellent command-line utility that allows you to display and manipulate JSON data, so you will also need to install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

## Making a curl Request

Open your terminal, and run the following curl command:

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl cURL
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{"url":"https://static.deepgram.com/examples/nasa-spacewalk-interview.wav"}' \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?punctuate=true'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](/docs/create-additional-api-keys).
</Warning>

Let’s look more closely at this request:

* `--request POST`: An HTTP request with the POST method.
* `--header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY'`: Includes authorization details and links the request with your Deepgram account and Project.
* `--header 'Content-Type: application/json'`: JSON data that will be sent with this request.
* `--data '{"url":"<https://static.deepgram.com/examples/nasa-spacewalk-interview.wav>"}'`: JSON data sent to Deepgram (an object containing one URL parameter).
* `--url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?punctuate=true'`: URL to which the request should be made (Deepgram's endpoint). `punctuate=true` enables the [punctuation](/docs/punctuation/) feature.
* `\`: Allows you to break one command over several lines for readability.

When you run this command and it is finished processing (often after only a few seconds), you’ll receive a JSON response that looks similar to the following:

![](/images/080c686-full-output.png)

This may look daunting, so let's look at a way to make both our curl request and our response easier to read.

## Shortening Your curl Request

Now that you've seen a full curl request and understand the required parameters, let's look at a more concise way to make the same request:

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl cURL
  curl https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?punctuate=true \
       -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"url":"https://static.deepgram.com/examples/nasa-spacewalk-interview.wav"}'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

In this example, notice:

* The URL comes immediately after the `curl` command.
* No HTTP method is present. Normally, this would default to a GET request, but because this request has a body, curl assumes a POST request.
* `--header` is shortened to `-H`
* `--data` is shortened to `-d`.

## Formatting Your JSON Response

To make the JSON response more readable, you can use `jq`, which is an excellent command-line utility that allows you to display and manipulate JSON data.

In the terminal, a pipe (`|`) is often used to send the output of one command as an input for a second command. `jq` expects some JSON as input, plus an expression to describe how to display it.

The following `jq` expression will extract just the transcript from the returned data object:

` | jq '.results.channels[0].alternatives[0].transcript'`

To use it, add it to the end of your curl request:

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl cURL
  curl https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?punctuate=true \
    -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"url":"https://static.deepgram.com/examples/nasa-spacewalk-interview.wav"}' \
    | jq '.results.channels[0].alternatives[0].transcript'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](/docs/create-additional-api-keys).
</Warning>

When you run this command and it is finished processing (often after only a few seconds), you’ll receive a JSON response that looks similar to the following:

![](/images/7e3313c-jq.png)

## Saving Output to a File

Once you have the transcript extracted and formatted using `jq`, you can redirect the output to a new file by appending `> output.txt` to any command that prints to the terminal. For example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl cURL
  curl https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?punctuate=true \
    -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"url":"https://static.deepgram.com/examples/nasa-spacewalk-interview.wav"}' \
    | jq '.results.channels[0].alternatives[0].transcript'
    > output.txt
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Processing Multiple Files

To process multiple files, you can create `.sh` files containing multiple lines of `bash` script to execute from your terminal.

Create a new file called `transcripts.sh`, and open it in a code editor. Populate it with the following:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  #!/bin/bash

  urls=("https://static.deepgram.com/examples/TrumpDemocratsMeeting.nancyshort.wav" "https://static.deepgram.com/examples/nasa-spacewalk-interview.wav" "https://static.deepgram.com/examples/deep-learning-podcast-clip.wav")

  dg_features="punctuate=true&utterances=true&diarize=true&tier=enhanced"
  dg_key="YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY"

  for url in ${urls[@]}; do
    filename=${url##*/}

    RESPONSE=$(
      curl -X POST https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?$dg_features \
           -H "Authorization: Token $dg_key" \
           -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
           -d "{\"url\":\"$url\"}"
    )

    echo $RESPONSE | jq '.results.channels[0].alternatives[0].transcript' > $filename.txt
  done
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](/docs/create-additional-api-keys).
</Warning>

In this file, notice:

* The first line (`#!/bin/bash`) is a shebang and specifies which program should be called to run the script. In this case, `bash`.

* `urls` is a variable containing an array with three URLs. The arrays use parentheses, and items are separated by only one space.

* `dg_features` and `dg_key` are variables you should alter for your exact use case. Note that the request, as written, uses Deepgram's punctuation, utterances, diarize, and tier features included in the `dg_features` variable.

* Inside the `for` loop:

  * `filename` extracts the last part of the URL (the filename), which will later be used to name the output file.
  * The `curl` command is the same as before, but with variables interpolated. The output is stored in a new variable called `RESPONSE`.
  * `RESPONSE` is sent to `jq`, and then redirected into a new text file.

Run the file in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  ./transcripts.sh
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Experimenting with jq

`jq` is a remarkable powerful tool that you can use to format data in more advanced ways. For example, the following expression will loop through the `results.utterances` array and format a string for each item, interpolating the speaker identifier and transcript text:

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  echo $RESPONSE | jq -r '.results.utterances[] | "[Speaker:\(.speaker)] \(.transcript)"' > $filename.txt
  ```
</CodeGroup>

When you run a previous curl command with this `jq` appended and it is finished processing, you’ll receive a JSON response formatted in the following way:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  [Speaker:0] agreement on other things that are really good. Nancy, would you like to say something?
  [Speaker:1] Well, thank you, mister president for the opportunity to meet with you so that we can work together in a bipartisan way
  [Speaker:1] to meet the needs of the American people. I think the American people recognize
  [Speaker:1] that we must keep government open, that a shutdown is not worth anything.
  [Speaker:1] And that you should
  ```
</CodeGroup>
