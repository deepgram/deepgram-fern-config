Real-time meeting transcription uses advanced voice technology for speech-to-text capture of what is discussed and decided in a meeting. With Deepgram’s API, you can add captions to live videos or display captions in real-time at conferences and events, and analyze spoken words for live content.

<Info>
  The demo code in this guide uses an older version of our Node SDK. A new version of our SDK is now available. [A migration guide is available](/docs/js-sdk-v2-to-v3-migration-guide).
</Info>

## Before You Begin

You will learn how to use Deepgram’s API and streaming endpoint to transcribe voice to text in real-time in a small video chat. The example provided is written in Node.js, and you can [find the code on GitHub](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/video-chat).

Before you run the code, you'll need to do a few things:

<Info>
  Before you can use Deepgram, you'll need to [create a Deepgram account](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys). Signup is free and includes **$200** in free credit and access to all of Deepgram's features!
</Info>

### Create a Deepgram API Key

To access Deepgram’s API, you'll need to [create a Deepgram API Key](/documentation/getting-started/authentication/#create-an-api-key). Make note of your API Key; you will need it later.

## Getting started

You can run this application on your local computer.

#### Configure the Settings

Your application will need to know more about you before it can run successfully. Edit the environment variables (`.env`) to reflect the settings you want to use:

* `PORT`: The port on which you want to run the application. We generally set this to port 3000.
* `DG_KEY`: The API Key you created earlier in this tutorial.

Once these variables are set, the application should run automatically.

### Run on localhost

To run this project on your local computer you will need to clone the repository, configure the settings, install the dependencies, and start the server.

#### Clone the Repository

Either clone or download the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/video-chat) to your local machine in a new directory:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Bash
  # Clone this repo
  git clone https://github.com/deepgram-devs/video-chat.git

  # Move to the created directory
  cd video-chat
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Configure the Settings

Your application will need to know more about you before it can run. Copy the `.env-example` file into a new file named `.env`, and edit the new file to reflect the settings you want to use:

* `PORT`: The port on which you want to run the application. You can leave this as port 3000.
* `DG_KEY`: The API Key you created earlier in this tutorial.

#### Install the Dependencies

In the directory where you downloaded the code, run the following command to bring in the dependencies needed for this project:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Bash
  npm install
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Start the Server

Now that you have configured your application and put the dependencies in place, your application is ready to go! Run it with:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Bash
  npm start
  ```
</CodeGroup>

By default, the application runs on port 3000, which means you can access it at `<http://localhost:3000>`.

## Code Walk-through

The application is an Express app that uses `public/js/video_chat.js` to build a two-way video call using classic WebRTC technology. It uses an intermediate server (`server.js`) to establish a peer-to-peer connection between itself and another client.

Your browser records your microphone using the [opus-recorder library](https://github.com/chris-rudmin/opus-recorder), then sends the audio stream to the server. In turn, the server forwards the audio stream to Deepgram’s API, using your Deepgram API Key to authenticate with the [real-time streaming endpoint](/api-reference/transcription/#transcribe-live-streaming-audio).

When the server receives the transcription back from the Deepgram API, it displays the transcription data in the browser. The key logic that connects to Deepgram and forwards any transcriptions it receives to the client application lives in the `server.js` file.

<Warning>
  You could directly connect the browser to Deepgram API, but this would require you to disclose your Deepgram API Key to the browser. This is very insecure and we don't recommend this.
</Warning>

## Negotiating the Peer Connection

To negotiate the peer connection, we call the `createAndSetupPeerConnection` function in `public/js/video_chat.js`. This function works with the `setupWebRTCSignaling` function in `server.js` to set up the peer connection using WebRTC, which is a fully peer-to-peer technology for the real-time exchange of audio, video, and data.

<Info>
  When using WebRTC, for two devices on different networks to locate each other, a form of discovery and media format negotiation must take place. This process is called signaling and involves both devices connecting to a third, mutually agreed-upon server. Through this third signaling server, the two devices can locate one another and exchange negotiation messages to resolve how to connect them over the internet.

  To negotiate the connection between them, the peers need to exchange Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) candidates, each of which describes a method that the sending peer is able to use to communicate. Each peer sends candidates in the order they're discovered and keeps sending candidates until it runs out of suggestions, even if media has already started streaming.

  The content of the message going through the signaling server is, in effect, a black box. What matters is that when the ICE subsystem instructs you to send signaling data to the other peer, you do so, and that the other peer knows how to receive this information and deliver it to its own ICE subsystem. All you have to do is channel the information back and forth.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  function createAndSetupPeerConnection(peerSocketId, localStream, remoteVideoNode, socket, allPeerConnections) {
  	// Create an RTC peer connection and add the connection to `allPeer Connections`.
  	const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection({
  		iceServers: [
  			{
  				urls: ["stun:stun.l.google.com:19302"],
  			},
  		],
  	});
  	allPeerConnections.set(peerSocketId, peerConnection);

  	// Add the local stream as outgoing tracks to the peer connection so the
  	// local stream can be sent to the peer.
  	localStream.getTracks().forEach((track) => peerConnection.addTrack(track, localStream));

  	// Forward ICE candidates to the peer through the socket. This is required
  	// by the RTC protocol to make both clients agree on what video/audio
  	// format and quality to use.
  	peerConnection.onicecandidate = (event) => {
  		if (event.candidate) {
  			socket.emit("ice-candidate", peerSocketId, event.candidate);
  		}
  	};

  	// Bind the incoming tracks to remoteVideoNode.srcObject, so we
  	// can see the peer's stream.
  	peerConnection.ontrack = (event) => {
  		remoteVideoNode.srcObject = event.streams[0];
  	};

  	return peerConnection;
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  function setupWebRTCSignaling(socket) {
  	// Handle the WebRTC "signaling", which means forwarding the necessary data
  	// to establish a peer-to-peer connection.
  	socket.on("video-offer", (id, message) => {
  		socket.to(id).emit("video-offer", socket.id, message);
  	});

  	socket.on("video-answer", (id, message) => {
  		socket.to(id).emit("video-answer", socket.id, message);
  	});

  	socket.on("ice-candidate", (id, message) => {
  		socket.to(id).emit("ice-candidate", socket.id, message);
  	});
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Sending Data to the Deepgram API

When your browser sends the audio stream to the server, we call the `setupRealtimeTranscription` function. This function calls the Deepgram API via a `wss` request, which establishes a WebSocket over an encrypted TLS connection. Real-time streaming uses WebSockets, a communications protocol that enables full-duplex communication, which means that you can stream new audio to Deepgram at the same time the latest transcription results are streaming back to you.

When connecting to the Deepgram server, you can configure options by appending query string parameters to the URL. To learn more about available options, check out our docs on the [Deepgram Live API](/reference/listen-live).

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript javascript
  const { Deepgram } = require("@deepgram/sdk");
  function setupRealtimeTranscription(socket, room) {
  	/** The sampleRate must match what the client uses. */
  	const sampleRate = 16000;

  	const deepgram = new Deepgram(DG_KEY);

  	const dgSocket = deepgram.transcription.live({
  		punctuate: true,
  	});

  	/** We must receive the very first audio packet from the client because
  	 * it contains some header data needed for audio decoding.
  	 *
  	 * Thus, we send a message to the client when the socket to Deepgram is ready,
  	 * so the client knows it can start sending audio data.
  	 */
  	dgSocket.addListener("open", () => socket.emit("can-open-mic"));

  	/**
  	 * We forward the audio stream from the client's microphone to Deepgram's server.
  	 */
  	socket.on("microphone-stream", (stream) => {
  		if (dgSocket.getReadyState() === WebSocket.OPEN) {
  			dgSocket.send(stream);
  		}
  	});

  	/** On Deepgram's server message, we forward the response back to all the
  	 * clients in the room.
  	 */
  	dgSocket.addListener("message", (transcription) => {
  		io.to(room).emit("transcript-result", socket.id, transcription);
  	});

  	/** We close the dsSocket when the client disconnects. */
  	socket.on("disconnect", () => {
  		if (dgSocket.getReadyState() === WebSocket.OPEN) {
  			dgSocket.finish();
  		}
  	});
  }
  ```

## Analyzing Results

When analyzing results, understand that real-time streaming returns a series of interim transcripts followed by a final transcript. To learn more about real-time streaming, see [Getting Started with Streaming Audio](/documentation/getting-started/streaming/). To learn more about interim and final transcripts, see [Interim Results](/documentation/features/interim-results/).
