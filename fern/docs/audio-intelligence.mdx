  An introduction to using Deepgram's audio intelligence features to analyze
  audio using Deepgram SDKs.
slug: docs/audio-intelligence
---


In this guide, you'll learn how to analyze audio using Deepgram's intelligence features: Summarization, Topic Detection, Intent Recognition, and Sentiment Analysis. The code examples use [Deepgram's SDKs](/docs/deepgram-sdks).

<Info>
  Before you start, you'll need to follow the steps in the [Make Your First API Request](/docs/make-your-first-api-request) guide to obtain a Deepgram API key, and configure your environment if you are choosing to use a Deepgram SDK.
</Info>

## What is Audio Intelligence?

Deepgram's Audio Intelligence API lets users send an audio source to Deepgram, and Deepgram will perform one of four types of analysis on the content of the audio after it has been transcribed. Read about each feature in its individual feature guides:

* [Summarization](/docs/summarization)
* [Topic Detection](/docs/topic-detection)
* [Intent Recognition](/docs/intent-recognition)
* [Sentiment Analysis](/docs/sentiment-analysis)

## API Playground

First, quickly explore Deepgram Audio Intelligence in our API Playground.

## Make the Request

A request made using one of the audio intelligence features will follow the same form for each of the features; therefore, this guide will walk you through how to make one request, and you can use the feature(s) of your choice depending on which feature you want to use (Summarization, Topic Detection, Intent Recognition, or Sentiment Analysis).

<Info>
  If you have made a request to [transcribe prerecorded audio](/docs/getting-started-with-pre-recorded-audio) using Deepgram's API, then you already know how to make an audio intelligence request. Audio intelligence requests are done exactly the same way!
</Info>

### Choose Your Audio Source

An audio source can be sent to Deepgram as an audio file or as a url of a hosted audio file. These are referred to as a **local file request** or a **remote file request** (which is a hosted url such as `https://YOUR_FILE_URL.txt`).

### Local File Request

This example shows how to analyze a **local audio file** as your audio source.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript
  const { createClient } = require("@deepgram/sdk");
  const fs = require("fs");

  const transcribeFile = async () => {
    // STEP 1: Create a Deepgram client using the API key
    const deepgram = createClient(process.env.DEEPGRAM_API_KEY);

    // STEP 2: Call the transcribeFile method with the audio payload and options
    const { result, error } = await deepgram.listen.prerecorded.transcribeFile(
      fs.readFileSync("callcenter.wav"),
      // STEP 3: Configure Deepgram options for audio analysis
      {
        model: "nova-3",
        sentiment: true,
        // intents: true,
        // summarize: "v2",
        // topics: true,
      }
    );

    if (error) throw error;
    // STEP 4: Print the results
    if (!error) console.dir(result, { depth: null });
  };

  transcribeFile();
  ```

  ```python Python
  import os
  from dotenv import load_dotenv

  from deepgram import (
      DeepgramClient,
      PrerecordedOptions,
      FileSource,
  )

  load_dotenv()

  # Path to the audio file
  AUDIO_FILE = "callcenter.wav"

  API_KEY = os.getenv("DG_API_KEY")

  def main():
      try:
          # STEP 1 Create a Deepgram client using the API key
          deepgram = DeepgramClient(API_KEY)

          with open(AUDIO_FILE, "rb") as file:
              buffer_data = file.read()

          payload: FileSource = {
              "buffer": buffer_data,
          }

          #STEP 2: Configure Deepgram options for audio analysis
          options = PrerecordedOptions(
            	model="nova-2",
              sentiment=True,
              # intents=True,
              # summarize="v2",
              # topics=True,
          )

          # STEP 3: Call the transcribe_file method with the audio payload and options
          response = deepgram.listen.prerecorded.v("1").transcribe_file(payload, options)

          # STEP 4: Print the response
          print(response.to_json(indent=4))

      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Exception: {e}")

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```

  ```go Go
  package main

  import (
  	"context"
  	"encoding/json"
  	"fmt"
  	"os"

  	prettyjson "github.com/hokaccha/go-prettyjson"

  	prerecorded "github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/pkg/api/prerecorded/v1"
  	interfaces "github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/pkg/client/interfaces"
  	client "github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/pkg/client/prerecorded"
  )

  // path to the audio file to analyze
  const (
  	filePath string = "./callcenter.wav"
  )

  func main() {
  	// STEP 1: init Deepgram client library
  	client.InitWithDefault()

  	// STEP 2: define context to manage the lifecycle of the request
  	ctx := context.Background()

  	// STEP 3: define options for the request
  	options := interfaces.PreRecordedTranscriptionOptions{
  		Model:     "nova-2",
  		Sentiment: true,
  		// Summarize: "v2",
  		// Topics: true,
  		// Intents:  true,
  	}

  	// STEP 4: create a Deepgram client using default settings
  	// NOTE: you can set your API KEY in your bash profile by typing the following line in your shell:
  	// export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY = "YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY"
  	c := client.NewWithDefaults()
  	dg := prerecorded.New(c)

  	// STEP 5: send/process file to Deepgram
  	res, err := dg.FromFile(ctx, filePath, &options)
  	if err != nil {
  		fmt.Printf("FromStream failed. Err: %v\n", err)
  		os.Exit(1)
  	}

  	// STEP 6: get the JSON response
  	data, err := json.Marshal(res)
  	if err != nil {
  		fmt.Printf("json.Marshal failed. Err: %v\n", err)
  		os.Exit(1)
  	}

  	// STEP 7: make the JSON pretty
  	prettyJson, err := prettyjson.Format(data)
  	if err != nil {
  		fmt.Printf("prettyjson.Marshal failed. Err: %v\n", err)
  		os.Exit(1)
  	}
  	fmt.Printf("\n\nResult:\n%s\n\n", prettyJson)
  }
  ```

### Remote File Request

This example shows how to analyze a **remote audio file** (a URL that hosts your audio file).

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript
  const { createClient } = require("@deepgram/sdk");

  const transcribeUrl = async () => {
    // STEP 1: Create a Deepgram client using the API key
    const deepgram = createClient(process.env.DEEPGRAM_API_KEY);

    // STEP 2: Call the transcribeUrl method with the audio payload and options
    const { result, error } = await deepgram.listen.prerecorded.transcribeUrl(
      {
        url: "https://dpgr.am/spacewalk.wav",
      },
      // STEP 3: Configure Deepgram options for audio analysis
      {
        model: "nova-3",
        sentiment: true,
        // intents: true,
        // summarize: "v2",
        // topics: true,
      }
    );

    if (error) throw error;
    // STEP 4: Print the results
    if (!error) console.dir(result, { depth: null });
  };

  transcribeUrl();
  ```

  ```python Python
  import os
  from dotenv import load_dotenv

  from deepgram import (
      DeepgramClient,
      PrerecordedOptions,
  )

  load_dotenv()

  # URL to the audio file
  AUDIO_URL = {
      "url": "https://static.deepgram.com/examples/Bueller-Life-moves-pretty-fast.wav"
  }

  API_KEY = os.getenv("DG_API_KEY")

  def main():
      try:
          # STEP 1 Create a Deepgram client using the API key
          deepgram = DeepgramClient(API_KEY)

          #STEP 2: Configure Deepgram options for audio analysis
          options = PrerecordedOptions(
              model="nova-2",
              sentiment=True,
              # intents=True,
              # summarize="v2",
              # topics=True,
          )

          # STEP 3: Call the transcribe_url method with the audio payload and options
          response = deepgram.listen.prerecorded.v("1").transcribe_url(AUDIO_URL, options)

          # STEP 4: Print the response
          print(response.to_json(indent=4))

      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Exception: {e}")

  	// STEP 4: create a Deepgram client using default settings
  	c := client.NewWithDefaults()
  	dg := prerecorded.New(c)

  	// STEP 5: send/process file to Deepgram
  	res, err := dg.FromURL(ctx, url, options)
  	if err != nil {
  		fmt.Printf("FromURL failed. Err: %v\n", err)
  		os.Exit(1)
  	}

  	// STEP 6: get the JSON response
  	data, err := json.Marshal(res)
  	if err != nil {
  		fmt.Printf("json.Marshal failed. Err: %v\n", err)

Following are explanations of each of the example responses. Be sure to click the tabs in the code block above to view the example response for each text analysis feature.

### All Audio Intelligence Features

Because Deepgram transcribes the audio before conducting the analysis, you will always see properties related to the transcription response, such as the following.

In the `results` object, we see:

* `transcript`: the transcript for the audio segment being processed.
* `confidence`: a floating point value between 0 and 1 that indicates overall transcript reliability. Larger values indicate higher confidence.
* `words`: an object containing each `word` in the transcript, along with its `start` time and `end` time (in seconds) from the beginning of the audio stream, and a `confidence` value.

### Summarization

In the `metadata` object, we see:

* `summary_info`: information about the model used and the input/output tokens. Summarization pricing is based on the number of input and output tokens. Read more at [deepgram.com/pricing](https://deepgram.com/pricing).
* `summary`: the `short` property in this object gives you the summary of the audio you requested to be analyzed.

### Topic Detection

In the `metadata` object, we see:

* `topics_info`: information about the model used and the input/output tokens. Topic Detection pricing is based on the number of input and output tokens. Read more at [deepgram.com/pricing](https://deepgram.com/pricing).

In the `results` object, we see:

* `topics`(object): contains the data about Topic Detection.

* `segments`: each segment object contains a span of text taken from the transcript; this `text` segment is analyzed for its topic.

* `topics`(array): a list of topic objects, each containing the `topic` and a `confidence_score`.

  * `topic`: Deepgram analyzes the segmented transcript to identify the main topic of each.
  * `confidence_score`: a floating point value between 0 and 1 indicating the overall reliability of the analysis.

### Intent Recognition

In the `metadata` object, we see:

* `intents_info`: information about the model used and the input/output tokens. Intent Recognition pricing is based on the number of input and output tokens. Read more at [deepgram.com/pricing](https://deepgram.com/pricing).

In the `results` object, we see:

* `intents`(object): contains the data about Intent Recognition.

* `segments`: each segment object contains a span of text taken from the transcript; this `text` segment is analyzed for its intent.

* `intents`(array): a list of intent objects, each containing the `intent` and a `confidence_score`.

  * `intent`: Deepgram analyzes the segmented transcript to identify the intent of each.
  * `confidence_score`: a floating point value between 0 and 1 indicating the overall reliability of the analysis.

### Sentiment Analysis

In the `metadata` object, we see:

* `sentiment_info`: information about the model used and the input/output tokens. Sentiment Analysis pricing is based on the number of input and output tokens. Read more at [deepgram.com/pricing](https://deepgram.com/pricing).

In the `results` object, we see:

* `sentiments`(object): contains the data about Sentiment Analysis.
* `segments`: each segment object contains a span of text taken from the transcript; these segments of text show when the sentiment shifts throughout the text, and each one is analyzed for its sentiment.
* `sentiment` can be `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral`.
* `sentiment_score`: a floating point value between -1 and 1 representing the sentiment of the associated span of text, with -1 being the most negative sentiment, and 1 being the most positive sentiment.
* `average`: the average sentiment for the entire transcript.

## Limits

### Language

At this time, audio analysis features only work for English language transcriptions.

### Token Limit

The input token limit is 150K tokens. When that limit is exceeded, a `400` error will be thrown

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "err_code": "TOKEN_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
    "err_msg": "Text input currently supports up to 150K tokens. Please revise your text input to fit within the defined token limit. For more information, please visit our API documentation.",
    "request_id": "XXXX"
  }
  ```
