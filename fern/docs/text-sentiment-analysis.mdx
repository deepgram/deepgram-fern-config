<Info>
  Try this feature out in our [API Playground](https://playground.deepgram.com/?endpoint=read\&sentiment=true\&language=en)!
</Info>

Sentiment Analysis accepts an input text, divides it into a list of segments comprised of sections of the text, and identifies the sentiment of each segment. It also assigns an average sentiment to the entire text.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json json
  "results": {
      "sentiments": {
        "segments": [
          {
            "text": "Hi. Thank you for calling from premier phone services.",
            "start_word": 0,
            "end_word": 8,
            "sentiment": "positive",
            "sentiment_score": 0.7380304336547852
          },
          {
            "text": "This call may be recorded for quality and training purposes.",
            "start_word": 9,
            "end_word": 18,
            "sentiment": "neutral",
            "sentiment_score": 0.057771213352680206
          }
        ],
        "average": {
          "sentiment": "positive",
          "sentiment_score": 0.39790084145285864
        }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

A `sentiment` of `positive`, `negative`, or `neutral` along with a `sentiment_score` is identified for each segment of the source text, and an `average` of the entire text's sentiment is also provided along with the average `sentiment_score`.

<Info>
  The break point for a `sentiment_score` becoming positive or negative is `+-0.333333333...`.

The `sentiment` values added to objects are:

* `sentiment`: The sentiment of the associated text (`positive` | `negative` | `neutral`).
* `sentiment_score`: A floating point value between -1 and 1 representing the sentiment of the associated span of text, with -1 being the most negative sentiment, and 1 being the most positive sentiment.
