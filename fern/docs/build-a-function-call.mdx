[Voice Agent](/docs/voice-agent)

This guide walks you through how to build a simple function call for a demo application. Please refer to this [code repository](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/flask-agent-function-calling-demo) for the complete application code.

## Getting Started

We'll setup a module called `functions.py` that defines a collection of functions and configurations which can be used in a Voice Agent API system for customer service automation. These functions will handle customer lookups, appointments, and order management through a set of async functions and standardized function definitions.

Please note: `functions.py` will rely on the [business\_logic.py](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/flask-agent-function-calling-demo/blob/main/business_logic.py) and the [client.py](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/flask-agent-function-calling-demo/blob/main/client.py) files to work end to end.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+
* Familiarity with Python
* An understanding of how to use Python Virtual environments.
* Familiarity with the [Deepgram Voice Agent API](/reference/build-a-voice-agent)

## Create the file

Create a file called `functions.py` and at the top of the file:

**Set Up the dependencies and Import the business logic**

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  import json
  from datetime import datetime, timedelta
  import asyncio
  from business_logic import (
      get_customer,
      get_customer_appointments,
      get_customer_orders,
      schedule_appointment,
      get_available_appointment_slots,
      prepare_agent_filler_message,
      prepare_farewell_message
  )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  This guide doesn't cover the development of the **business logic** for this application. Please see [this code](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/flask-agent-function-calling-demo/blob/main/business_logic.py) for more details on the business logic used.
</Info>

## Implement the Functions

We'll start with the customer lookup function:

This function handles:

* Multiple lookup methods (phone, email, ID)
* Standardized ID formatting (CUSTXXXX)
* Phone number normalization (+1XXXXXXXXXX)
* Email address parsing

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  async def find_customer(params):
      """Look up a customer by phone, email, or ID."""
      phone = params.get("phone")
      email = params.get("email")
      customer_id = params.get("customer_id")
      
      result = await get_customer(phone=phone, email=email, customer_id=customer_id)
      return result
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Next we'll create a function to find customer appointments for a specific customer:

This function handles:

* retrieving all appointments for a specific customer using their customer ID.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  async def get_appointments(params):
      """Get appointments for a customer."""
      customer_id = params.get("customer_id")
      if not customer_id:
          return {"error": "customer_id is required"}
      
      result = await get_customer_appointments(customer_id)
      return result
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Next we'll create a function to do appointment management:

This function handles:

* Scheduling new appointments
* Checking availability
* Retrieving existing appointments

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  async def get_orders(params):
      """Get orders for a customer."""
      customer_id = params.get("customer_id")
      if not customer_id:
          return {"error": "customer_id is required"}
      
      result = await get_customer_orders(customer_id)
      return result
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Next we'll create a function to do order management:

This function handles:

* Order history lookup
* Order status checking

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  async def create_appointment(params):
      """Schedule a new appointment."""
      customer_id = params.get("customer_id")
      date = params.get("date")
      service = params.get("service")
      
      if not all([customer_id, date, service]):
          return {"error": "customer_id, date, and service are required"}
      
      result = await schedule_appointment(customer_id, date, service)
      return result
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Next will create a function to find available appointment times:

This function handles:

* Finding available appointment slots
* Pre-scheduling availability checks
* Responding to "When can I come in?" queries

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  async def check_availability(params):
      """Check available appointment slots."""
      start_date = params.get("start_date")
      end_date = params.get("end_date", (datetime.fromisoformat(start_date) + timedelta(days=7)).isoformat())
      
      if not start_date:
          return {"error": "start_date is required"}
      
      result = await get_available_appointment_slots(start_date, end_date)
      return result
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Next will setup a function to handle conversational flow:

This function handles:

* Agent filler messages for natural interaction
* Proper conversation closure handling

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python

  async def agent_filler(websocket, params):
      """
      Handle agent filler messages while maintaining proper function call protocol.
      """
      result = await prepare_agent_filler_message(websocket, **params)
      return result
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Finally we'll create a function to end the call gracefully.

This function handles:

* Conversation closure
* Adding appropriate farewell messages

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python

  async def end_call(websocket, params):
      """
      End the conversation and close the connection.
      """
      farewell_type = params.get("farewell_type", "general")
      result = await prepare_farewell_message(websocket, farewell_type)
      return result
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Create Function Definitions

Next well need to setup `FUNCTION_DEFINITIONS` Which is an array that defines the API contract for the Voice Agent system. It specifies all available operations, their parameters, and usage guidelines.

Each function definition follows a JSON Schema format with:

* Name
* Description
* Parameters specification
* Required fields
* Enumerated values where applicable

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  # Function definitions that will be sent to the Voice Agent API
  FUNCTION_DEFINITIONS = [
      {
          "name": "agent_filler",
          "description": """Use this function to provide natural conversational filler before looking up information.
          ALWAYS call this function first with message_type='lookup' when you're about to look up customer information.
          After calling this function, you MUST immediately follow up with the appropriate lookup function (e.g., find_customer).""",
          "parameters": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                  "message_type": {

                      "enum": ["lookup", "general"]
                  }
              },
              "required": ["message_type"]

              "required": ["farewell_type"]
          }
      }
  ]
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Create a Function Map

Finally we'll need to create a`FUNCTION_MAP` which is a dictionary that maps function names to their corresponding implementation functions. It serves as a routing mechanism to connect the function definitions with their actual implementations.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  # Map function names to their implementations
  FUNCTION_MAP = {
      "find_customer": find_customer,
      "get_appointments": get_appointments,
      "get_orders": get_orders,
      "create_appointment": create_appointment,
      "check_availability": check_availability,
      "agent_filler": agent_filler,
      "end_call": end_call
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Call the functions from `client.py`

<Info>
  This guide doesn't cover the development of the client application but you can refer to the [client code](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/flask-agent-function-calling-demo/blob/528d1eb1ecab427db874e586e251ebb048701323/client.py#L184) for how you can connect your Voice Agent to`functions.py` as well as the documentation [Configuring the Voice Agent](/docs/configure-voice-agent).
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
  ```python python
  # Example of the Voice Agent Settings Configuration used the Demo app

  SETTINGS = {
      "type": "SettingsConfiguration",
      "audio": {
          "input": {
              "encoding": "linear16",
              "sample_rate": USER_AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE,
          },
          "output": {
              "encoding": "linear16",
              "sample_rate": AGENT_AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE,
              "container": "none",
          },
      },
      "agent": {
          "listen": {"model": "nova-3"},
          "think": {
              "provider": {"type": "open_ai"},
              "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
              "instructions": PROMPT_TEMPLATE,
              "functions": FUNCTION_DEFINITIONS,
          },
          "speak": {"model": VOICE},
      },
      "context": {
          "messages": [
              {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! I'm Sarah from TechStyle customer service. How can I help you today?"}
          ],
          "replay": True
      }
  }
  ```
