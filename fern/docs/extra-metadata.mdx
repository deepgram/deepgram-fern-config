Deepgram’s Extra Metadata feature allows you to attach arbitrary key-value pairs to your API requests that are attached to the API response for usage in downstream processing.

Extra metadata is limited to 2048 characters per key-value pair.

## Enable Feature

To enable Extra Metadata, when you call Deepgram’s API, add an `extra` parameter in the query string and pass a key-value pair you would like to include in the response.

`extra=KEY:VALUE`

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following cURL command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?extra=KEY:VALUE'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](%F0%9F%94%97).
</Warning>

## Response

If you included `extra=myKey:someValue` in your request, the key-value pair would be passed through to the response in the following format:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "metadata": {
      "extra": {
        "myKey": "someValue"
      }
      ...
    }
    ...
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Special Considerations

### White Space or Special Characters

If your extra metadata includes spaces or special characters, be sure to URL encode it:

`extra=dataflow:marketing%20team` or `extra=dataflow:marketing+team`

### Apply Multiple Instances

To apply multiple extra key-value pairs, submit the query parameter multiple times in your API request:

`extra=team:marketing&extra=purpose:legal`

<Warning>
  If you request contains multiple instances of `extra` with the same key, the corresponding values will *not* be merged. Instead, the last value will overwrite any previous values.

  For example, `extra=team:marketing&extra=team:gtm` will return `"extra": { "team": "gtm" }` in the response.
</Warning>

## Comparison to Tagging

[Tagging](/docs/tagging) is a similar feature to Extra Metadata. Where Extra Metadata is primarily intended for passing data to downstream processing steps, Tagging is useful for tracking and filtering usage.

Below is a comparison table summarizing the main differences between the two features:

|                                                           | Extra Metadata | Tagging   |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| Primarily for passing data to downstream processing steps | ✅              | ❌         |
| Primarily for tracking usage                              | ❌              | ✅         |
| Configurable per request                                  | ✅              | ✅         |
| Configurable per API key                                  | ❌              | ✅         |
| Character limit per value                                 | 2048 chars     | 128 chars |

| Can specify a key in a key-value pair                     | ✅              | ❌         |

|                                                           |                |           |
