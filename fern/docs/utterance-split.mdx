Deepgram’s Utterance Split feature monitors incoming audio and detects when a sufficiently long pause is detected between words. By default, the length of time Deepgram uses for Utterance Split is 0.8 seconds, but you can configure this value using the `utt_split` parameter.

## Enable Feature

To enable Utterance Split, when you call Deepgram’s API, add an `utt_split` parameter in the query string and set it to the length of time (in seconds) of silence between words after which Deepgram will decide that a new utterance should begin. The default values is 0.8 s.

`utt_split=LENGTH-OF-TIME-IN-SECONDS`

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following curl command in a terminal or your favorite API client and define the utterance split value you'd wish to use:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash curl
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
    --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?utterances=true&utt_split=LENGTH-OF-TIME-IN-SECONDS'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](/docs/create-additional-api-keys).
</Warning>
