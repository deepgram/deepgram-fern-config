title: Metrics Guide
subtitle: >-
  Monitoring system metrics is an important part of maintaining a healthy
  Deepgram self-hosted deployment. Metrics can also aid in decision making
  around scaling and performance concerns. To this end, Deepgram services
  publish a variety of metrics on exposed endpoints that you can query to
  determine system health.

Each section also contains details on implementing image-specific liveness and readiness probes. These should be implemented when using a container orchestration tool that supports health probes. For example, the [`deepgram-self-hosted` Helm chart](https://github.com/deepgram/self-hosted-resources/tree/main/charts/deepgram-self-hosted) includes these checks by default.

## Deepgram API

For self-hosted deployments, the Deepgram API container images expose an endpoint `/v1/status`, on port 8080 by default. Querying this endpoint will yield three pieces of information:

1. If a successful response is received, the API is alive and listening to messages
2. The response body gives a backward-looking indication of `system_health`
3. The response body indicates how many requests this API instance is processing

### Liveness Probe

Use a TCP check on the open port (port 8080 by default).

### Readiness Probe

Query the status of the `/v1/status/engine`endpoint and check whether it is in a `"Connected"` state with at least one Engine container.

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  curl --silent http://localhost:PORT/v1/status/engine | grep --quiet -e '^{\"engine_connection_status\"\:\"Connected\".*}$'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Make sure to replace the `PORT` placeholder with the port your container is listening on (port 8080 by default).
</Info>

### Model Metadata

Make a GET request to list all models the Engine has loaded, along with their metadata. For broader information, see the [Model Metadata endpoint documentation](/docs/model-metadata). When pointed at a self-hosted deployment, this endpoint is helpful to confirm that models present in your models directory are being loaded by the container as expected.

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/v1/models'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Deepgram Engine

The Deepgram Engine container image publishes an extensive set of system metrics. These metrics are configured on a separate endpoint and port than the main service.

### Docker/Podman

Choose a host port `HOST_PORT` where external queries can be made, and choose a container port `CONTAINER_PORT` where Engine can internally publish its metrics. These can be the same port number, since they are binding to different networks (the host network versus the container network)

<Warning>
  "Port collision" can occur when you try to bind to the same port from two different services. Since we are binding to both a container port and a host port, we have to be aware of this on two different networks.

  When selecting a host port, do not use the same port that is used by any other Deepgram service, or any other service running on the host machine. In the default Deepgram `docker-compose.yml` file, the API often uses port `8080`, and the License Proxy often uses ports `8443` and `8089`. A common default value for the Engine `HOST_PORT` is `9991`.

  When selecting a container port, do not select port `8080`, as this is used on the container network to communicate between the Engine and the API. A common default value for the Engine `CONTAINER_PORT` is `9991`.
</Warning>

Within your `docker-compose.yml` file you must publish the internal container port to the external host port, as shown below. See [Published Ports](https://docs.docker.com/network/#published-ports) in the official Docker documentation for more details.

<CodeGroup>
  ```yaml YAML
  services:
    engine:
      # other definitions
      ports:
        - "HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

To modify the Engine configuration, edit your `engine.toml` file to specify the container port to publish metrics to:

<CodeGroup>
  ```toml toml
  # To support metrics we need to expose an Engine endpoint
  [metrics_server]
    host = "0.0.0.0"
    port = CONTAINER_PORT
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Make sure to replace the placeholders `HOST_PORT` and `CONTAINER_PORT` in both of the above snippets.
</Info>

Metrics may now be queried from the self-hosted instance on the local host at `:HOST_PORT/metrics`.

### Kubernetes

The Engine metrics endpoint is exposed by default by the `deepgram-self-hosted` Helm chart via a NodePort Service. This service's name is defined as the `.engine.namePrefix` configuration values appended by `-metrics`. By default, this service will be named `deepgram-engine-metrics`. See the `engine.metricsServer.*` [configuration values](https://github.com/deepgram/self-hosted-resources/tree/main/charts/deepgram-self-hosted#values) for more options.

When `scaling.auto.enabled` is set to `true`, the Engine metrics endpoint will be automatically scraped by Prometheus and used for auto-scaling.

### Available Metrics

Upon startup of the containers, a limited set of metrics will be available until the first request is made. After the first request is made a complete set of metrics will be available.

#### Initial Metrics

`engine_estimated_stream_capacity` value will increase as you open more streams until you reach the GPU capacity. This means it will start off low and increase as more streams are opened. When `engine_estimated_stream_capacity` stops increasing this is when you have reached the GPU Stream capacity

```
# HELP engine_estimated_stream_capacity The number of streams the node believes it can serve with acceptable latency.

#### Streaming latency metrics

Together, the `engine_stream_latency_bucket` metrics may be used to plot a histogram of streaming latency in Grafana, using the PromQL queries below. This set of metrics tracks the latency of each new stream. With this data, distribution and trends in streaming latency may be monitored for each deployment.

```
histogram_quantile(0.10, sum by (le) (rate(engine_stream_latency_bucket[5m]))) or vector(0)
histogram_quantile(0.25, sum by (le) (rate(engine_stream_latency_bucket[5m]))) or vector(0)
histogram_quantile(0.50, sum by (le) (rate(engine_stream_latency_bucket[5m]))) or vector(0)
histogram_quantile(0.75, sum by (le) (rate(engine_stream_latency_bucket[5m]))) or vector(0)
histogram_quantile(0.90, sum by (le) (rate(engine_stream_latency_bucket[5m]))) or vector(0)
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum by (le) (rate(engine_stream_latency_bucket[5m]))) or vector(0)
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum by (le) (rate(engine_stream_latency_bucket[5m]))) or vector(0)
```

### Liveness Probe

Use a TCP check on the open port (port 8080 by default).

### Readiness Probe

Use a TCP check on the open port (port 8080 by default).

## Deepgram License Proxy

For self-hosted deployments, the Deepgram License Proxy container images expose an endpoint `/v1/status`, on port 8080 by default. Querying this endpoint will indicate if the license proxy is able to communicate with the Deepgram license server.

### Liveness Probe

Use a TCP check on the open status port (port 8080 by default).

### Readiness Probe

Query the status of the `/v1/status`endpoint and check the connection state.

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell Shell
  curl --silent http://localhost:8080/v1/status | grep --quiet -e '^{.*\"state\"\:\"\(Connected\|TrustBased\)\".*}$'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Make sure to replace the `PORT` placeholder with the port your container is listening on (port 8080 by default).
</Info>

## Summary

To access metrics for the API, Engine, and License Proxy containers, run the following CURL request from the same machine the containers are running on. The ports in the commands below are the default port numbers; check your configuration files to see if the port mapping was changed.

* API: `curl "http://localhost:8080/v1/status"` and `curl "http://localhost:8080/v1/status/engine"`
* Engine: `curl "http://localhost:9991/metrics"`
* License Proxy: `curl "http://localhost:8080/v1/status"`
