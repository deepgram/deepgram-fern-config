# Entity Detection

When Entity Detection is enabled, the [Punctuation](/documentation/features/punctuate/) feature will be enabled by default.

## Enable Feature

To enable Entity Detection, when you call Deepgram’s API, add a `detect_entities` parameter set to `true` in the query string:

`detect_entities=true&punctuate=true`

<Info>
  When Entity Detection is enabled, [Punctuation](/documentation/features/punctuate/) will also be enabled by default.

To transcribe audio from a file on your computer, run the following curl command in a terminal or your favorite API client.

<CodeGroup>
  ```curl cURL
  curl \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
    --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
    --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
    --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?detect_entities=true&punctuate=true'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).
</Warning>

## Analyze Response

When the file is finished processing (often after only a few seconds), you’ll receive a JSON response that has the following basic structure:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  {
    "metadata": {
      "transaction_key": "string",
      "request_id": "string",
      "sha256": "string",
      "created": "string",
      "duration": 0,
      "channels": 0
    },
    "results": {
      "channels": [
        {
          "alternatives":[],
        }
      ]
    }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Let's look more closely at the `alternatives` object:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json JSON
  "alternatives":[
    {
      "transcript":"Welcome to the Ai show. I'm Scott Stephenson, cofounder of Deepgram...",
      "confidence":0.9816771,
      "words": [...],
      "entities":[
        {
          "label":"NAME",
          "value":" Scott Stephenson",
          "confidence":0.9999924,
          "start_word":6,
          "end_word":8
        },
        {
          "label":"ORG",
          "value":" Deepgram",
          "confidence":0.9999757,
          "start_word":10,
          "end_word":11
        },
        {
          "label": "CARDINAL_NUM",
          "value": "one",
          "confidence": 1,
          "start_word": 186,
          "end_word": 187
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
  ]
  ```
</CodeGroup>

In this response, we see that each alternative contains:

* `transcript`: Transcript for the audio being processed.
* `confidence`: Floating point value between 0 and 1 that indicates overall transcript reliability. Larger values indicate higher confidence.
* `words`: Object containing each word in the transcript, along with its start time and end time (in seconds) from the beginning of the audio stream, and a confidence value.
* `entities`: Object containing the information about entities for the audio being processed.

And we see that each `entities` object contains:

* `label`: Type of entity identified.
* `value`: Text of entity identified.
* `confidence`: Floating point value between 0 and 1 that indicates entity reliability. Larger values indicate higher confidence.
* `start_word`: Location of the first character of the first word in the section of audio being inspected for entities.
* `end_word`: Location of the first character of the last word in the section of audio being inspected for entities.

<Info>
  All entities are available in English.

## Use Cases

Some examples of uses for Entity Detection include:

* Customers who want to improve Conversational AI and Voice Assistant by triggering particular workflows and responses based on identified name, address, location, and other key entities.
* Customers who want to enhance customer service and user experience by extracting meaningful and relevant information about key entities such as a person, organization, email, and phone number.
* Customers who want to derive meaningful and actionable insights from the audio data based on identified entities in conversations.
